# Notes for Claude

## Workflow
- Always commit and push changes when you stop to talk to me

# MBASIC Project Rules

## File Organization Rules

### Utility Scripts
**ALWAYS put utility scripts in `utils/` directory**
- Python scripts for analysis, testing, debugging, etc.
- Examples: categorize_files.py, find_duplicates.py, analyze_errors.py
- Never create utility scripts in the root directory

### BASIC Program Organization
- `basic/` - Working BASIC programs that parse correctly with MBASIC 5.21
- `basic/bad_syntax/` - Programs with syntax errors or non-MBASIC 5.21 features
- `basic/bas_tests/` - Test programs and test files
- `basic/tests_with_results/` - Test files with expected results

### Source Code
- `mbasic.py` - Main interpreter (root directory)
- Core implementation files in root (parser.py, lexer.py, etc.)

### Input Files
- `in/` - Input files for testing and unsqueezing

### Documentation
- `README.md` - Main project documentation (root)
- Other docs in root directory

## Code Style
- Python 3 with type hints where appropriate
- Use pathlib for file operations when possible
- Include docstrings for functions
- Add comments explaining complex logic

## Testing

### Testing with Python Implementation
- Test files should be in `basic/bas_tests/`
- Use MBASIC 5.21 syntax only
- Test both successful parsing and error cases
- Run with: `python3 mbasic.py <program.bas>`

### Testing with Real MBASIC 5.21

**IMPORTANT:** To verify behavior against authentic MBASIC 5.21, use the tnylpo CP/M emulator.

**Location:** Real MBASIC 5.21 is at `com/mbasic.com`

**How to run:**
```bash
cd tests/
(cat test.bas && echo "RUN") | timeout 10 tnylpo ../com/mbasic
```

**Critical requirements:**
1. **Must run from `tests/` directory**
2. **Programs must end with `SYSTEM` not `END`**
   - `END` hangs at "Ok" prompt waiting for input
   - `SYSTEM` exits MBASIC cleanly
3. **Keep lines short** (MBASIC has line buffer limits)

**Example test file:**
```basic
10 PRINT "Hello"
20 FOR I = 1 TO 3
30   PRINT I
40 NEXT I
50 SYSTEM
```

**Comparing outputs:**
```bash
cd tests/

# Our implementation
python3 ../mbasic.py test.bas > /tmp/our.txt 2>&1

# Real MBASIC 5.21
(cat test.bas && echo "RUN") | timeout 10 tnylpo ../com/mbasic > /tmp/real.txt 2>&1

# Compare
diff /tmp/our.txt /tmp/real.txt
```
