# Notes for Claude

## Workflow
- Track all installed dependencies and update documentation
- **Check `docs/dev/WORK_IN_PROGRESS.md` on EVERY startup** - contains current task that may be incomplete

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Running Real MBASIC Comparisons

**READ THIS FIRST when user asks to compare with real MBASIC 5.21**

This section exists because every day I forget how to do this and it takes 10+ tries. DON'T BE THAT CLAUDE. Read this carefully.

**Full documentation:** `tests/HOW_TO_RUN_REAL_MBASIC.md`

**Quick Reference - DO THIS:**

```bash
# 1. MUST cd to tests directory FIRST
cd /home/wohl/cl/mbasic/tests

# 2. Create test program that MUST end with SYSTEM not END
cat > test.bas << 'EOF'
10 PRINT "Hello"
20 FOR I = 1 TO 3
30   PRINT I
40 NEXT I
50 SYSTEM
EOF

# 3. Run our implementation
python3 ../mbasic.py test.bas > /tmp/our_output.txt 2>&1

# 4. Run real MBASIC (pipe content, don't pass filename)
(cat test.bas && echo "RUN") | timeout 10 tnylpo ../com/mbasic > /tmp/real_output.txt 2>&1

# 5. Compare
diff /tmp/our_output.txt /tmp/real_output.txt
```

**Critical requirements (NEVER forget these):**
1. **MUST run from `tests/` directory** - tnylpo needs relative path to `../com/mbasic`
2. **MUST pipe program content** - Cannot pass filename to tnylpo
3. **MUST end with `SYSTEM`** - `END` hangs waiting for input
4. **MUST use `(cat file && echo "RUN")`** - Pipes content then RUN command
5. **Keep lines short** - MBASIC has line buffer limits

**Why this exists:** User said "every day when i ask you to compare a basic program in our basic vs real it takes you like 10 tries to get it work". This is unacceptable. Follow the instructions above EXACTLY.

## Git Commit and Push Workflow

**Use checkpoint script for ALL commits:**

```bash
./checkpoint.sh "Your commit message"
```

This automatically:
- Increments VERSION in src/version.py (1.0.5 → 1.0.6)
- Rebuilds help indexes if docs/help/ files changed
- Runs git add -A
- Commits with version number in message
- Pushes to remote

**Always checkpoint when stopping to talk to user.**

**Note:** If you modify files in `docs/help/`, the checkpoint script automatically runs `python3 utils/build_help_indexes.py` to rebuild search indexes before committing.

## Work-in-Progress Tracking

**CRITICAL: Track all immediate work in `docs/dev/WORK_IN_PROGRESS.md` to survive crashes/unexpected shutdowns.**

### On Every Startup
1. **ALWAYS check if `docs/dev/WORK_IN_PROGRESS.md` exists**
2. **If it exists**: Read it and inform user what was being worked on
3. **Ask user**: "Do you want to continue this work, or start something new?"

### When Starting Immediate Work
**Before implementing anything**, update `WORK_IN_PROGRESS.md` with:
- What you're working on
- Current status (what's done, what's next)
- Files being modified
- Any important context

### When Completing Work
**Delete or clear `WORK_IN_PROGRESS.md`** when task is complete and committed.

### File Format
```markdown
# Work in Progress

## Task
Brief description of what's being implemented

## Status
- ✅ Step 1 completed
- ⏳ Step 2 in progress
- ⏸️ Step 3 pending

## Files Modified
- path/to/file1.py
- path/to/file2.py

## Next Steps
1. Complete step 2
2. Test feature
3. Commit changes

## Context/Notes
Any important details needed to resume work
```

### Example Usage
```
User: "Can you fix the array bounds checking bug?"
Claude: Updates WORK_IN_PROGRESS.md → starts fixing → crash
User: Restarts Claude
Claude: Checks WORK_IN_PROGRESS.md → "I see you were fixing array bounds checking. Continue?"
```

## TODO Tracking Rules

**CRITICAL: When you agree to implement a feature or add something to a todo list, it MUST be documented in a file with "TODO" in the filename.**

- **Why**: User searches for files with "TODO" in the name to resume work
- **Where**: Create files in `docs/dev/` with pattern `*_TODO.md`
- **When to create**:
  - User requests a new feature for future implementation
  - You agree to add something to a todo list
  - Planning multi-step work that won't be completed immediately
- **What to include**:
  - Clear description of what needs to be done
  - Implementation details and approaches
  - Priority level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
  - Status section (⏳ TODO at top of file)
  - Test cases and acceptance criteria
- **When complete**: Move file to `docs/history/` and rename TODO → DONE
  - Example: `ARRAY_ELEMENT_SELECTOR_TODO.md` → `history/ARRAY_ELEMENT_SELECTOR_DONE.md`

**Examples**:
- User: "Can you add a way to edit array elements by typing indices?"
- Claude: "Yes! Let me document that." → Creates `docs/dev/ARRAY_ELEMENT_SELECTOR_TODO.md`

**Don't create TODO files for**:
- Tasks you're implementing immediately in the same session
- Simple bug fixes being done right now
- Questions or discussions without actionable work

## Debugging

### Debug Mode
When debugging errors, enable debug mode for detailed output:
```bash
MBASIC_DEBUG=1 python3 mbasic.py program.bas
```

This outputs detailed error traces to stderr (visible to Claude) while keeping the UI clean.
See `docs/dev/DEBUG_MODE.md` for full details.

### Persistent Debug Mode
**CRITICAL: MBASIC_DEBUG must ALWAYS be enabled in .bashrc:**
```bash
export MBASIC_DEBUG=1
```

**Purpose:** Ensures ALL unexpected errors are automatically sent to Claude via the debug link.
**Do NOT disable this** - it's not for controlling verbose debug output, it's for error visibility.

After adding to .bashrc, restart the shell or run `source ~/.bashrc`.

### Debug Levels
Control verbosity with MBASIC_DEBUG_LEVEL (requires MBASIC_DEBUG=1):
- **Level 1 (default)**: Errors only - unexpected errors sent to stderr
- **Level 2 (verbose)**: Detailed debug output (e.g., FOR loop stack operations)

```bash
# For verbose debugging output:
export MBASIC_DEBUG_LEVEL=2
```

### Checking Debug Output
**When debugging, ALWAYS check the debug link for stderr output:**
- Debug output is automatically sent via the debug link
- Check the debug link/logs when investigating errors
- Debug prints from Python code use debug_logger.debug_log()
- User may reference "check your debug link" or "it was sent to stderr" - this means check the debug output system

### Adding Debug Output
Use the debug_logger module, not raw print statements:
```python
from src.debug_logger import debug_log

# Error-level debug (always shown when MBASIC_DEBUG=1)
debug_log("Important error info", level=1)

# Verbose debug (only shown when MBASIC_DEBUG_LEVEL=2)
debug_log("Detailed operation", context={'var': value}, level=2)
```

# MBASIC Project Rules

## File Organization Rules

### Utility Scripts
**ALWAYS put utility scripts in `utils/` directory**
- Python scripts for analysis, testing, debugging, etc.
- Examples: categorize_files.py, find_duplicates.py, analyze_errors.py
- Never create utility scripts in the root directory

### BASIC Program Organization
- `basic/` - Working BASIC programs that parse correctly with MBASIC 5.21
- `basic/bad_syntax/` - Programs with syntax errors or non-MBASIC 5.21 features
- `basic/bas_tests/` - Test programs and test files
- `basic/tests_with_results/` - Test files with expected results

### Source Code
- `mbasic.py` - Main interpreter (root directory)
- Core implementation files in root (parser.py, lexer.py, etc.)

### Input Files
- `in/` - Input files for testing and unsqueezing

### Documentation
**NEVER create documentation files in the root directory!**
All documentation belongs in the `docs/` directory:

- `README.md` - Main project README (root, only exception)
- `docs/` - **ALL documentation goes here**
  - `docs/dev/` - Current development notes and implementation guides
    - Use for: feature implementations, fixes, current status, work-in-progress
    - Examples: `*_IMPLEMENTATION.md`, `*_FIX.md`, `STATUS.md`
  - `docs/help/` - In-UI help system documentation
    - `docs/help/common/` - General help shared across all UIs (language, statements)
    - `docs/help/ui/{backend}/` - UI-specific help (cli, curses, tk, visual)
  - `docs/user/` - External user-facing documentation
    - Use for: quick references, installation guides, tutorials
  - `docs/history/` - Historical/archived development documentation
    - Use for: session logs, completed milestones (move from dev/ when done)
  - `docs/design/` - Architecture and design documents
  - `docs/external/` - External references (PDFs, specifications)

**When creating new documentation:**
- Development notes → `docs/dev/`
- Help content → `docs/help/common/` or `docs/help/ui/{backend}/`
- User guides → `docs/user/`
- Completed sessions → `docs/history/`

## Code Style
- Python 3 with type hints where appropriate
- Use pathlib for file operations when possible
- Include docstrings for functions
- Add comments explaining complex logic

## UI/UX Rules
- **NO FUNCTION KEYS** - User cannot use F1-F12 keys
- Use Ctrl+letter combinations instead (Ctrl+G, Ctrl+T, etc.)
- All keyboard shortcuts must be Ctrl, Alt, or plain keys
- Document all keyboard shortcuts clearly

## Testing

### Testing with Python Implementation
- Test files should be in `basic/bas_tests/`
- Use MBASIC 5.21 syntax only
- Test both successful parsing and error cases
- Run with: `python3 mbasic.py <program.bas>`

### Testing with Real MBASIC 5.21

**IMPORTANT:** To verify behavior against authentic MBASIC 5.21, use the tnylpo CP/M emulator.

**Location:** Real MBASIC 5.21 is at `com/mbasic.com`

**How to run:**
```bash
cd tests/
(cat test.bas && echo "RUN") | timeout 10 tnylpo ../com/mbasic
```

**Critical requirements:**
1. **Must run from `tests/` directory**
2. **Programs must end with `SYSTEM` not `END`**
   - `END` hangs at "Ok" prompt waiting for input
   - `SYSTEM` exits MBASIC cleanly
3. **Keep lines short** (MBASIC has line buffer limits)

**Example test file:**
```basic
10 PRINT "Hello"
20 FOR I = 1 TO 3
30   PRINT I
40 NEXT I
50 SYSTEM
```

**Comparing outputs:**
```bash
cd tests/

# Our implementation
python3 ../mbasic.py test.bas > /tmp/our.txt 2>&1

# Real MBASIC 5.21
(cat test.bas && echo "RUN") | timeout 10 tnylpo ../com/mbasic > /tmp/real.txt 2>&1

# Compare
diff /tmp/our.txt /tmp/real.txt
```

**Full details:** See `tests/HOW_TO_RUN_REAL_MBASIC.md`

### Testing the Curses UI

**IMPORTANT:** The curses UI cannot be tested manually in headless environments. Use the automated testing framework.

**Quick test (recommended):**
```bash
python3 utils/test_curses_comprehensive.py
```

**What it tests:**
- UI creation and initialization
- Input handlers (Ctrl+H, Ctrl+L, Ctrl+N, Ctrl+R, etc.)
- Program parsing from editor
- Program execution with tick-based interpreter
- Process lifecycle (startup/shutdown)

**Exit codes:**
- `0` - All tests passed
- `1` - One or more tests failed (details in output)

**When to use:**
- Before committing changes to curses UI
- After modifying interpreter tick-based execution
- When debugging curses UI issues
- To verify UI works without manual testing

**Available test scripts:**
- `utils/test_curses_comprehensive.py` - Full test suite (use this)
- `utils/test_curses_pexpect.py` - Integration testing only
- `utils/test_curses_pyte.py` - Terminal emulator (experimental)
- `utils/test_curses_urwid_sim.py` - Direct simulation testing

**Full documentation:** See `docs/dev/CURSES_UI_TESTING.md`

**Common errors caught:**
- `loop.draw_screen()` called before loop running
- Missing interpreter initialization
- Input handler exceptions
- Tick execution errors
