# CLEAR

## Syntax

```basic
CLEAR [,[<expression1>] [,<expression2>]]
```

**Versions:** 8K, -Extended, Disk

## Purpose

To set all numeric variables to zero and all string variables to null; and, optionally, 'to set the end of memory and the amount of stack space.

## Remarks

CLEAR resets all variables to their initial values (0 for numbers, empty for strings) and optionally configures memory usage.

### Parameters

- **expression1**: If specified, sets the highest memory location available for BASIC to use
- **expression2**: Sets the stack space reserved for BASIC (default: 256 bytes or 1/8 of available memory, whichever is smaller)

### Memory Management

**Note about string space:** In BASIC-80 release 5.0 and later (including MBASIC 5.21), string space is allocated dynamically. You'll only get an "Out of string space" error if there's no free memory left.

**Historical note:** In earlier versions of BASIC-80, expression1 set the amount of string space and expression2 set the end of memory. This behavior changed in release 5.0.

## Example

```basic
CLEAR
                CLEAR ,32768
                CLEAR ,,2000
                CLEAR ,32768,2000
```
