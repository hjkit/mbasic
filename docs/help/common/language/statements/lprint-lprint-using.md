# LPRINT AND LPRINT USING

## Implementation Note

⚠️ **Not Implemented**: This feature requires line printer hardware and is not implemented in this Python-based interpreter.

**Behavior**: Statement is parsed but no output is sent to a printer

**Why**: Line printers are obsolete hardware. Modern systems use different printing paradigms (print spooling, PDF generation, etc.).

**Alternative**: Use [PRINT](print.md) to output to console or [PRINT#](printi-printi-using.md) to output to a file, then print the file using your operating system's print facilities.

**Historical Reference**: The documentation below is preserved from the original MBASIC 5.21 manual for historical reference.

## Syntax

```basic
LPRINT [<list of expressions>]
LPRINT USING <string exp>i<list of expressions>
LSET <string variable> = <string expression>
RSET <string variable> = <string expression>
```

**Versions:** Extended, Disk Disk

## Purpose

To print data at the line printer. To move data from memory to a random file buffer (in preparation for a PUT statement) •

## Remarks


## Example

```basic
150 LSET A$=MKS$(AMT)
              160 LSET D$=DESC($~
              See also Appendix B.
NOTE:         LSET or RSET may also be used with a non-fielded
              string variable to left-justify or right-justify
              a string in a given field.    For example, the
              program lines
                      110 A$=SPACE$(20)
                      120 RSET A$=N$
              right-justify the string N$ in a 20-character
              field.   This can be very handy for formatting
              printed output.
