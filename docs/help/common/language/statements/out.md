# OUT

## Implementation Note

⚠️ **Not Implemented**: This feature requires direct hardware I/O port access and is not implemented in this Python-based interpreter.

**Behavior**: Statement is parsed but no operation is performed

**Why**: Cannot access hardware I/O ports from a Python interpreter. OUT was used to control hardware devices through port-based I/O.

**Historical Reference**: The documentation below is preserved from the original MBASIC 5.21 manual for historical reference.

## Syntax

```basic
OUT I,J
where I and J are    integer   expressions     in   the
range 0 to 255.
```

## Purpose

To send a byte to a machine output port.

## Remarks

The integer expression I is the port number, and the integer expression J is the data to be transmitted.

## Example
