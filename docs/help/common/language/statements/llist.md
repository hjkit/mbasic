# LLIST

## Syntax

```basic
LLIST [<line number>[-[<line number>]]]
```

## Purpose

To list all or part of the program currently     in memory at the line printer.

## Remarks

LLIST assumes a l32-character wide printer. BASIC-80 always returns to command level after an LLIST is executed. The options for LLIST are the same as for LIST, Format 2. NOTE:           LLIST and LPRINT are not       included    in   all implementations of BASIC-80.

## Example

```basic
See the examples for LIST, Format 2.
