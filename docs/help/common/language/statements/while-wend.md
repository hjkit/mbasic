# WHILE ••• WEND

## Syntax

```basic
WHILE <expression>
[<loop statements>]
WEND
```

## Purpose

To execute a series of statements in a   loop   as long as a given condition is true.

## Remarks

If <expression> is not zero (Le., true), <loop statements>    are  executed   until    the WEND statement is encountered. BASIC then returns to the WHILE statement and checks <expression>. If it is still true, the process is repeated.    If it is not true, execution resumes with the statement following the WEND statement. WHILE/WEND loops may be nested to any level. Each WEND will match the most recent WHILE. An unmatched WHILE statement causes       a    nWHILE without WEND n error, and an unmatched WEND statement causes a nWEND without WHILE n error,.

## Example

```basic
90~BUBBLE SORT ARRAY A$
              100 FLIPS=l ~FORCE ONE PASS TaRU LOOP
              110 WHILE FLIPS
              115        FLIPS=O
              120        FOR I=l TO J-l
              130                IF A$(I»A$(I+l) THEN
                                         SWAP A$(I) ,A$(I+l) :FLIPS=l
              140        NEXT I
              150 WEND
```
