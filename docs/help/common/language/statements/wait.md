# WAIT

## Implementation Note

⚠️ **Not Implemented**: This feature requires direct hardware I/O port access and is not implemented in this Python-based interpreter.

**Behavior**: Statement is parsed but no operation is performed

**Why**: Cannot access hardware I/O ports from a Python interpreter. WAIT was used to synchronize with hardware devices by polling I/O ports.

**Historical Reference**: The documentation below is preserved from the original MBASIC 5.21 manual for historical reference.

## Syntax

```basic
WAIT <port number>, • I[,J]
where I and J are integer expressions
```

## Purpose

To suspend program execution while      monitoring the status of a machine input port.

## Remarks

The WAIT statement causes execution to       be suspended until a specified machine input port develops a specified bit pattern. The data read at the port is exclusive OR~ed with the integer expression J, and then AND~ed with 1.   If the result is zero, BASIC-80 loops back and reads the data at the port again. If the result is nonzero,   execution continues with the next statement. If J is omitted, it is assumed to be zero CAUTION:      It is possible to enter an infinite loop with the WAIT statement, in which case it will be necessary to manually restart the machine.

## Example

```basic
100 WAIT 32,2
```
