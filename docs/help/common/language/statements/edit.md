# EDIT

## Syntax

```basic
EDIT <line number>
```

## Purpose

To enter Edit Mode at the specified line.

## Remarks

In Edit Mode, it is possible to edit portions of a line without retyping the entire line. Upon entering Edit Mode, BASIC-SO types the line number of the line to be edited, then it types a space and waits for an Edit Mode subcommand. ---- Edit ---- Mode Subcommands ~~~~~~ Edit Mode subcommands are used to move the cursor or to insert, delete, replace, or search for text within a line. The subcommands are not echoed.   Most of the Edit Mode subcommands may be preceded by an integer which causes the command to be executed that number of times. When a preceding integer is not specified, it is assumed to be 1. Edit Mode subcommands     may   be    categorized according to the following functions: 1.   Moving the cursor 2.   Inserting text 3.   Deleting text 4.   Finding text 5.   Replacing text 6.   Ending and restarting Edit Mode N~E In the descriptions that follow,    <ch> represents    any    character,   <text> represents a string of characters of arbitrary   length,  [iJ  represents an optional integer (the default is 1), and $ represents the Escape     (or Altmode) key. BASIC-SO COMMANDS AND STATEMENTS                        Page 2-20 1.   Moving the Cursor Space     Use the space bar to move the cursor to the right.   [iJSpace moves the cursor i spaces to the right. Characters are printed as you space over them. Rubout    In Edit Mode,   [i]Rubout moves the cursor i spaces to the left (backspaces). Characters are printed as you backspace over them. 2.   Inserting Text I         I<text>$ inserts <text> at the current cursor position.   The inserted characters are printed on the terminal. TO terminate insertion, type Escape.   If Carriage Return is typed during an Insert command, the effect is the same as typing Escape and then Carriage Return.       During an Insert command, the Rubout or Delete key on the terminal may be used to delete characters to the left of the cursor. If an attempt is made to insert a character that will make the line longer than 255 characters, a bell (Control-G) is typed and the character is not printed. X          The X subcommand is used to extend the line.     X • mo.ves 'the '" cursor to the end of the line, goes into insert mode, and allows insertion of text as if an Insert command had been given. When you are finished extending the line, type Escape or Carriage Return. 3.   Oeleting'Te~t o         [i]D deletes i characters to the right of the cursor.    The deleted characters are echoed between   backslashes,   and   the  cursor is positioned to the right of the last character deleted. If there are fewer than i characters to the right of the cursor, iO deletes the remainder of the line. H         H deletes all characters to the     right of the curSQr and then automatically       enters insert mode. H is useful for replacing     statements at the end of a line. 4.   Finding Text S         The subcommand [i]S<ch> searches for the ith occurrence of <ch> and positions the cursor before it. The character at the current cursor position is not included in the search. If <ch> is not found, the cursor will stop at the end of BASIC-80 COMMANDS AND STATEMENTS                    Page 2-21 the line. All characters passed over during the search are printed. K      The subcommand [i]K<ch> is similar to [i]S<ch>, except all the characters passed over in the search are deleted. The cursor is positioned before <ch>, and the deleted characters are enclosed in backslashes. s.   Replacing Text C      The subcommand C<ch> changes the next character to <ch>.    If you wish to change the next i characters, use the subcommand iC, followed by i characters.   After the ith new character is typed, change mode is exited and you will return to Edit Mode. 6.   Ending and Restarting Edit Mode <cr>    Typing Carriage Return prints the remainder of the line, saves the changes you made and exits Edit Mode. E      The E subcommand has the same effect as Carriage Return, except the remainder of the line is not printed. Q      The Q subcommand returns to BASIC-80 ..¥command " level, without saving any of the changes that were made to the line during Edit Mode. L       The L subcommand lists the remainder of the line (saving any changes made so far) and repositions the cursor at the beginning of the line, still in Edit Mode.     L  is usually used to list the line when you first enter Edit Mode. A      The A subcommand lets you begin editing a line over again.    It restores the original line and repositions the cursor at the beginning. NOTE If BASIC-80 receives an unrecognizable command or illegal character while in Edit Mode, it prints a bell (Control-G) and the command or character is ignored. BASIC-SO COMMANDS AND STATEMENTS                   Page 2-22 Syntax Errors When a Syntax Error is encountered     during execution of a program, BASIC-SO automatically enters Edit Mode at the line that caused the error. For example: 10 K = 2(4) RON ?Syntax error in 10 10 When you finish editing the line and type Carriage Return (or the E subcommand), BASIC-SO reinserts the line, which causes all variable values to be lost.      To preserve the variable values for examination , first exit Edit Mode with the 0 subcommand. BASIC-SO will return to command level, and all variable values will be preserved. Control-A To enter Edit Mode on the line you are currently typing, type Control-A. BASIC-SO responds with a carriage return, an exclamation point (1) and a space.    The cursor will be positioned at the first character in the line. Proceed by typing an Edit Mode subcommand. NOTE Remember, if you have just entered a line and wish to go back and edit it, the command nEDIT.n will enter Edit Mode at the current line.    (The line number symbol n.n always refers to the current line. ) BASIC-SO COMMANDS AND STATEMENTS                    Page 2-23
