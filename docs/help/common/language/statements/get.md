# GET

## Syntax

```basic
GET [#]<file number>[,<record number>]
```

**Versions:** Disk

## Purpose

To read a record from a random disk file into    a random buffer.

## Remarks

<file number> is the number under which the file was OPENed. If <record number> is omitted, the next record (after the last GET)  is read into the buffer. The largest possible record number is 32767.

## Example

```basic
See Appendix B.
NOTE:         After a GET statement, INPUT# and LINE INPUT#
              may be done to read characters from the random
              file buffer.
```
