# LPOS

## Implementation Note

⚠️ **Not Implemented**: This feature requires line printer hardware and is not implemented in this Python-based interpreter.

**Behavior**: Function always returns 0

**Why**: Line printers are obsolete hardware. There is no printer print head to track in modern systems.

**Alternative**: Use [POS](pos.md) to get the current console print position, or track position manually when writing to files with [PRINT#](../statements/printi-printi-using.md).

**Historical Reference**: The documentation below is preserved from the original MBASIC 5.21 manual for historical reference.

## Syntax

```basic
LPOS(X)
```

**Versions:** Extended, Disk

## Description

Returns the current position of the line printer print head within the line printer buffer. Does not necessarily give the physical position of the print head. X is a dummy argument.

## Example

```basic
100 IF LPOS(X) >60 THEN LPRINT CHR$(13)
```
