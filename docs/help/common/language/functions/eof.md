# EOF

## Syntax

```basic
EOF(file number)
```

**Versions:** Disk

## Description

Returns -1 (true) if the end of a sequential file has been reached. Use EOF to test for end-of-file while INPUTting, to avoid "Input past end" errors.

## Example

```basic
10 OPEN "I",l,"DATA"
 20 C=O
 30 IF EOF(l) THEN 100
 40 INPUT #l,M(C)
 50 C=C+l:GOTO 30
```
