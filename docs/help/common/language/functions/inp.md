# INP

## Implementation Note

⚠️ **Not Implemented**: This feature requires direct hardware I/O port access and is not implemented in this Python-based interpreter.

**Behavior**: Always returns 0

**Why**: Cannot access hardware I/O ports from a Python interpreter. This function is specific to systems with memory-mapped I/O or port-based hardware interfaces.

**Historical Reference**: The documentation below is preserved from the original MBASIC 5.21 manual for historical reference.
