# Essential TK GUI Features

The Tkinter GUI provides powerful features for BASIC development.

## Smart Insert ({{kbd:smart_insert}})

**The fastest way to add code between existing lines!**

Example:
```basic
10 PRINT "START"
20 PRINT "END"
```

Press {{kbd:smart_insert}} on line 10 → Automatically inserts line 15!

No mental math required.

## Syntax Checking

The editor checks syntax as you type (100ms delay).

- Red **?** appears in gutter for errors
- Error message shown in output pane
- Fix the error → **?** disappears automatically

## Breakpoints

**Set breakpoints:**
- Click line number in gutter
- Or press {{kbd:toggle_breakpoint}}
- Blue ● appears

**Debug with:**
- {{kbd:step_statement}} - Execute next statement
- {{kbd:step_line}} - Execute next line
- {{kbd:continue_execution}} - Continue to next breakpoint

## Variables Window ({{kbd:toggle_variables}})

Shows all variables with:
- Name (case preserved - displays as you typed!)
- Value
- Type (integer, float, string, array)

Updates in real-time during debugging.

## Execution Stack ({{kbd:toggle_stack}})

Shows active FOR loops and GOSUB calls. Perfect for understanding nested structures.

## Find and Replace ({{kbd:find_replace}})

Search and replace across your entire program.
