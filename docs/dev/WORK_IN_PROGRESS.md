# Work In Progress: Web UI Spacing and Error Reporting Fixes

**Date**: 2025-11-04
**Version**: 1.0.617 → targeting 1.0.618+

## Current Status: DEBUGGING - AVOIDING LOOP

**User complaint**: "note ive asked you fix this at least 6 times. so keep detailed notes in work in progress and watch out for being in a loop"

## Issues to Fix

### 1. Web UI Spacing - ✅ FIXED!
**Status**: COMPLETE - User confirmed "spacing is good now"

**Problem**: User reported "4 bands of white" between top 4 rows (menu, toolbar, command input, status bar)

**Root cause discovered**: NiceGUI's default page container has hardcoded CSS gap property that creates vertical spacing (see GitHub issue #2171)

**Solution (v1.0.634-635)**:
- v1.0.634: Wrapped all 4 top rows in `ui.column().style('row-gap: 0; width: 100%;')` - eliminated unwanted gaps
- v1.0.635: Added 2px margin around toolbar for visual breathing room + moved main content into column wrapper to eliminate gap between status bar and editor

**Final result**: Clean, compact layout with appropriate spacing

### 2. Duplicate Line Numbers in Error Messages ⚠️
**Status**: Not started

**Problem**: Error messages show line number twice:
```
10: Syntax error in 10: Lexer error at 1:23...
```

**Root cause**: `src/ui/web/nicegui_backend.py:2371` adds `f'Line {line_num}: '` prefix, but the exception message already contains line number info from `src/editing/manager.py:372`

**Fix**: Strip the redundant prefix from error messages in web UI

### 3. Lexer Reports Wrong Line:Column ⚠️
**Status**: Not started

**Problem**: Lexer says "at 1:23" when it should say "at 10:23" (BASIC line number)

**Root cause**: Lexer uses internal token coordinates, not BASIC line numbers

**Fix**: Need to pass BASIC line number context to lexer error reporting

### 4. BASIC Syntax Issue with `$a` ⚠️
**Status**: CONFUSED - need to verify with manual/real MBASIC

**Problem**: User's code `line input "foo" ; $a` gets error: `Unexpected character: '$' (0x24)`

**User says**: The manual shows using `:` separator (I incorrectly told them to use `;`)

**CRITICAL**: Before fixing anything else, I need to:
1. Check the actual Microsoft BASIC manual for LINE INPUT syntax
2. Test with real MBASIC 5.21 to see the correct syntax
3. Verify whether `$a` or `A$` is correct (I claimed `A$` but need to verify)

## Files Modified So Far
- `src/ui/web/nicegui_backend.py` (spacing CSS, v1.0.599-617)

## Files That Need Changes
- `src/ui/web/nicegui_backend.py` (_check_syntax method, line 2371)
- `src/editing/manager.py` (error formatting, line 372)
- `src/lexer.py` (error reporting with BASIC line numbers)
- CSS spacing in nicegui_backend.py (lines 1108-1133)

## Loop Prevention Strategy
1. ✅ Created this WORK_IN_PROGRESS.md doc
2. ✅ Using TodoWrite to track tasks
3. 🔄 BEFORE making any changes: Verify assumptions with manual/real MBASIC
4. 🔄 Test ONE fix at a time, get user feedback before moving to next
5. 🔄 If spacing fix doesn't work, ask user for screenshot or browser inspector info

## Status Update (Latest)

**v1.0.630** - ✅ LINE INPUT COMPLETE! Fixed duplicate prompt and placeholder text

**Breakthrough approach (v1.0.628)**: User suggested "how about taking over the immediate box for input?"
- MUCH simpler than making output editable!
- When state.input_prompt detected: focus immediate_entry, change placeholder to "Input: "
- On Enter: check waiting_for_input flag → submit to interpreter.provide_input() or execute as immediate command
- After input submitted: restore placeholder to "BASIC command..."

**Fixed in v1.0.630**:
1. ✅ Removed duplicate prompt (interpreter already prints it via io.output() at line 1733)
2. ✅ Changed placeholder from "BASIC command..." to "Input: " when waiting for input
3. ✅ Restored placeholder after input submitted

**Fixed in v1.0.629**:
- Fixed AttributeError: changed immediate_input → immediate_entry

**Fixed in v1.0.628**:
- User-suggested approach: take over immediate mode input box for LINE INPUT
- Added waiting_for_input flag and input_prompt_text tracking
- Modified _on_immediate_enter() to intercept Enter when waiting for input

**Fixed in v1.0.627**:
- JavaScript syntax error (unescaped line breaks in run_method calls)
- Changed multi-line JavaScript strings to single-line

**Fixed in v1.0.626**:
1. Status updates to "Waiting for input..." ✓ (already working from v1.0.620)
2. Attempted to make output editable (abandoned approach)

**Still broken**:
- Spacing - too much gap between top rows (NEXT PRIORITY)

## Status: LINE INPUT ✅ COMPLETE - User confirmed "that works great"

## Next Steps (IN ORDER)
1. **NEXT**: Fix spacing issue - too much gap between top rows
2. **LATER**: Fix lexer line:column reporting
