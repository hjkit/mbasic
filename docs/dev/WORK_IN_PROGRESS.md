# Work in Progress

## Status: Ready for Next Task

**Version**: 1.0.149+ (as of 2025-10-28)

### Recently Completed (v1.0.149+)

**Help System Search Improvements** - COMPLETE

Added three major improvements to the TK help browser:

1. ✅ **Search Result Ranking** - Results now ranked by relevance:
   - Exact title match (score: 100)
   - Title contains query (score: 10)
   - Exact keyword match (score: 50)
   - Keyword contains query (score: 5)
   - Description contains query (score: 2)
   - Type/category match (score: 1)
   - Results sorted by score descending

2. ✅ **Fuzzy Matching** - Handles typos in search:
   - Simple Levenshtein distance algorithm (no dependencies)
   - Edit distance ≤ 2 for words ≥ 4 characters
   - Examples: "prnt" finds "PRINT", "inpt" finds "INPUT"
   - Applied to titles and keywords only
   - Only used when no exact matches found

3. ✅ **In-Page Search (Ctrl+F)** - Find text within current help page:
   - Press Ctrl+F to open search bar
   - All matches highlighted in yellow
   - Current match highlighted in orange
   - Next/Prev buttons to navigate matches
   - Shows "N/M" match counter
   - Press Escape or click Close to dismiss

### Files Modified

**Implementation:**
- `src/ui/tk_help_browser.py` - Added search ranking, fuzzy matching, and in-page search

**Testing:**
- `tests/regression/help/test_help_search_ranking.py` - Unit tests for search logic (✓ PASSING)
- `tests/manual/test_help_search_improvements.py` - Manual test instructions

### Test Results

```bash
$ python3 tests/regression/help/test_help_search_ranking.py
Ran 7 tests in 0.062s
OK
```

All tests pass:
- ✓ Fuzzy match with exact match
- ✓ Fuzzy match with typos
- ✓ Fuzzy match with character swaps
- ✓ Short queries don't fuzzy match
- ✓ Very different strings don't match
- ✓ Search ranking by relevance
- ✓ Fuzzy matching fallback
