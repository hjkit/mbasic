This document tracks what's **not yet implemented** in the JavaScript backend.

## ⚠️ STUBBED (Partially Implemented)

_None currently - all previously stubbed features have been implemented_

## 🔧 KNOWN ISSUES / TODOs

### Fixed Issues (Phase 2)
1. ✓ **GOSUB return address** - Now properly calculates next statement/line
2. ✓ **FOR loop skip** - When initial condition not met, jumps to line after NEXT
3. ✓ **NEXT without variable** - Now uses most recent FOR loop

- ✓ TAB() - Tab to column (simplified implementation)
- ✓ SPC() - Print N spaces
- ✓ INSTR() - Find substring position
- ✓ SPACE$() - Generate N spaces
- ✓ STRING$() - Repeat character N times
- ✓ FIX() - Truncate to integer (rounds toward zero)
- ✓ SGN() - Sign of number
- ✓ CINT() - Convert to integer (round)
- ✓ CSNG() - Convert to single precision (no-op in JavaScript)
- ✓ CDBL() - Convert to double precision (no-op in JavaScript)
- ✓ HEX$() - Number to hex string
- ✓ OCT$() - Number to octal string
- ✓ POS() - Current print position (simplified)

### Missing Runtime Functions (Hardware/System)
- PEEK() - Read memory (not applicable in JavaScript)
- POKE - Write to memory (not applicable in JavaScript)
- INP() - Read I/O port (not applicable in JavaScript)
- OUT - Output to I/O port (not applicable in JavaScript)
- USR() - Call machine code (not applicable in JavaScript)

8. ✓ Additional math functions (FIX, SGN, CINT, CSNG, CDBL)
9. ✓ STOP statement
10. ✓ ON GOSUB - Computed subroutine calls
11. ✓ ERASE - Reset arrays
12. ✓ Error handling (ON ERROR, RESUME, ERROR, ERL, ERR)
13. ✓ PRINT USING - Formatted output (simplified)

### MEDIUM (Nice to have)
1. MID$ assignment - String modification

### LOW (Specialized/Advanced)
1. File I/O (OPEN, CLOSE, etc.)
2. CHAIN - Program chaining
3. Graphics (not in MBASIC 5.21)
4. Sound (not in MBASIC 5.21)
5. Machine code / hardware access (POKE, PEEK, CALL, etc.)

### NOT APPLICABLE (Interactive/Editor)
- LIST, NEW, RUN, LOAD, SAVE, DELETE, RENUM
- HELP, SET, SHOW
- CONT, STEP

## 📝 Notes

- **File I/O**: Could implement with localStorage (browser) and fs module (Node.js)
- **Graphics**: Could use Canvas API (browser), skip in Node.js
- **Sound**: Could use Web Audio API (browser), skip in Node.js
- **Screen control**: Could implement CLS/LOCATE/COLOR for browser, map to ANSI codes in Node.js
- **Hardware access**: POKE/PEEK/OUT/INP not meaningful in JavaScript, could stub or error
