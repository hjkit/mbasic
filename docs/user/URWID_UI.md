├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Status: Ready - Press Ctrl+M for menu, Ctrl+H help │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Column Layout

Each line has a fixed column structure:

| Columns | Purpose | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| [0] | Status | `?` = error (highest), `●` = breakpoint, ` ` = normal |
| [1-5] | Line Number | 5 digits, right-aligned (e.g., "   10") |
| [6] | Separator | Always a space character |
| [7+] | Code | BASIC program code |

**Status Priority:**
When a line has multiple states (error + breakpoint), the status character shows the highest priority:
1. **Error (`?`)** - Highest priority, always shown when syntax error exists
2. **Breakpoint (`●`)** - Shown when no error but breakpoint is set
3. **Normal (` `)** - Default when neither error nor breakpoint

**Example:** If line 10 has both an error and a breakpoint:
- While error exists: `?   10 foo` (shows error)
- After fixing error: `●   10 PRINT "ok"` (shows breakpoint)

**Example line format:**
```
●   10 PRINT "Hello"
^   ^^ ^
│   │  │
│   │  └─ Separator (column 6)
│   └──── Line number (columns 1-5)
└──────── Status (column 0)
```

### Menu System

The UI includes a menu bar at the top showing the main command categories: **File**, **Edit**, **Run**, and **Help**.

#### Accessing the Menu

Press `Ctrl+M` to show a popup menu with all available commands organized by category.

## How to Use

### 1. Enter a Program

Type BASIC code with line numbers in the editor:

```basic
10 PRINT "Hello, World!"
20 FOR I = 1 TO 5
30 PRINT "Count: "; I
40 NEXT I
50 END
```

### 2. Run the Program

Press `Ctrl+R` to execute. The output will appear in the output window below the editor.

### 3. List the Program

Press `Ctrl+L` to see a formatted listing of your program.

### 4. Clear and Start Over

Press `Ctrl+N` to clear the editor and start a new program.

### 5. Get Help

Press `Ctrl+H` anytime to see the help dialog with all keyboard shortcuts.

## Line Number Editing

### Calculator-Style Digit Entry

Line numbers work like a 5-digit calculator display:

```
Initial:     10
Type '5':   105
Type '0':  1050
Type '0': 10500  (next digit would drop leftmost '1')
```

**Features:**
- **Overwrite mode** in columns 1-5
- **Right-justified** automatically when leaving the area
- **Leftmost digit drops** when typing at rightmost position (column 5)
- **Backspace** deletes rightmost digit and right-justifies

**Example editing session:**
```
Line:    10 PRINT "Hello"
         ^^

Edit to '101':
1. Move cursor to line number area (columns 1-5)
2. Type '1' → '110'
3. Backspace → '11 '
4. Left arrow (move to column 4)
5. Type '0' → '101'
6. Down arrow → line sorts into position
```

### Protected Areas

- **Status column (0)**: Read-only, cursor moves to line number area
- **Separator (6)**: Protected from deletion/editing
- **Code area (7+)**: Normal text editing

### Backspace Behavior

| Cursor Position | Backspace Action |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Column 1-5 (line number) | Delete rightmost digit, right-justify |
| Column 6 (separator) | Delete rightmost digit of line number |
| Column 7 (code start) | Move to column 6 (protect separator) |
| Column 8+ (code area) | Normal backspace |

## Auto-Numbering

### Default Behavior

When you press Enter on a line, the next line automatically gets a line number:

```
  10 PRINT "Hello"
[Press Enter]
  20 ← Auto-numbered
```

### Configuration

Auto-numbering can be configured in `.mbasic.conf`:

```ini
[editor]
# Starting line number for new programs
auto_number_start = 10

# Increment between auto-numbered lines
auto_number_increment = 10

# Enable/disable auto-numbering
auto_number_enabled = true
```

Configuration file search order:
1. `.mbasic.conf` in current directory
2. `.mbasic.conf` in home directory (`~/.mbasic.conf`)

### Smart Line Numbering

Auto-numbering intelligently avoids collisions:

```
Existing lines: 10, 20, 30, 100, 200

Current line: 20
Press Enter → Next line: 30 (would collide!)
              Actual: 21 (first available after 20)

Current line: 30
Press Enter → Next line: 40
              Actual: 40 (no collision, uses increment)

Current line: 100
Press Enter → Next line: 110
              Actual: 110 (no collision)
```

**Algorithm:**
1. Calculate: `next = current_line + increment`
2. Check if `next` would collide with existing line
3. If collision: use `current_line + 1` (or next available)
4. If above next line in sequence: use next available slot

## Paste Operations

### High-Performance Paste

The editor is optimized for pasting large amounts of code:

- **Instant display** - Pasted text appears in ~0.1 seconds
- **Deferred processing** - Line number parsing and sorting happens after paste completes
- **No lag** - Fast path for normal characters bypasses expensive text parsing
- **Automatic formatting** - Pasted code is automatically formatted on display

### Smart Line Number Parsing

When you paste BASIC code, line numbers are automatically detected and formatted:

#### Pasting Code Without Line Numbers

```basic
Paste:
for i=0 to 10
print i
next

Result (with auto-numbering):
   10 for i=0 to 10
   20 print i
   30 next
   40
```

Auto-numbering adds line numbers to plain code.

#### Pasting Code With Line Numbers

```basic
Paste:
210 for i=0 to 10
220  print i
230 next

Result:
  210 for i=0 to 10
  220 print i
  230 next
  240
```

**Key behaviors:**
- Line numbers from pasted code are **preserved**
- Extra spaces after line numbers are **removed** (e.g., "220  print" becomes "220 print")
- Numbers in code area are **moved to line number column**
- Replaces any auto-numbered values
- Next line continues auto-numbering from last pasted number

#### Mixed Paste (Into Auto-Numbered Lines)

If you paste "210 for..." into a line that already has auto-number "10":

```basic
Before:
   10

Paste: 210 for i=0 to 10

After:
  210 for i=0 to 10
```

The pasted line number (210) **replaces** the auto-number (10).

### Edge-to-Edge Display

The editor has **no left border** for clean copy/paste:

```
── Editor ────────────────────────
   10 PRINT "Hello"
   20 FOR I = 1 TO 10
   30 PRINT I
   40 NEXT I
```

When you select and copy text from the terminal, you get clean code without border characters.

### Scrollable Output

Press `Tab` to switch between editor and output window:

- **Editor mode** - Edit your program
- **Output mode** - Scroll through program output with Up/Down arrows
- Press `Tab` again to return to editor

Output window can display unlimited lines and is fully scrollable.

## Automatic Syntax Checking

The editor automatically checks syntax as you type and marks errors with the '?' indicator.

### How It Works

- **Real-time checking** - Syntax is validated after 0.1s of idle time
- **Visual feedback** - Lines with parse errors show '?' in status column
- **Error messages** - Detailed error descriptions appear in output window
- **Auto-clearing** - Error markers disappear when you fix the syntax
- **Safe operation** - Uses isolated parser, won't affect running programs or breakpoints

### Status Column Indicators

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| ` ` (space) | Normal line, no errors |
| `?` | Parse error (syntax problem) |
| `●` | Breakpoint set (not yet implemented) |

### Examples

**Valid syntax:**
```basic
   10 PRINT "Hello"
   20 FOR I = 1 TO 10
   30 NEXT I
```

**With syntax errors:**
```basic
   10 PRINT "Hello"
?  20 FOR I = 1 TO       (incomplete statement)
?  30 PRINT "Missing     (missing closing quote)
   40 END
```

**Output window shows:**
```
=== Syntax Errors ===

Line 20: Expected expression after TO
Line 30: Unterminated string
```

### Error Messages

When syntax errors are detected, detailed messages appear in the output window:

**Format:**
```
=== Syntax Errors ===

Line <number>: <error description>
```

**Example error messages:**
- `Invalid statement: 'foo' is not a BASIC keyword` - Bare identifier
- `Unterminated string` - Missing closing quote
- `Expected expression after TO` - Incomplete FOR loop
- `Unexpected token: THEN` - Syntax error in IF statement

**Behavior:**
- Errors update automatically as you type
- Sorted by line number for easy reference
- Clear when you fix all errors
- Replaced by program output when you run code

### What Gets Checked

The parser validates:
- **Lexical errors** - Invalid tokens, unterminated strings
- **Syntax errors** - Incomplete statements, wrong keyword usage
- **Statement structure** - Proper BASIC statement format

### What Doesn't Get Checked

Runtime-only errors are **not** detected:
- Variable not defined (runtime error)
- Array out of bounds (runtime error)
- Division by zero (runtime error)
- Type mismatches (detected at runtime)
- Line number references (GOTO/GOSUB to non-existent line)

### Performance

Syntax checking is optimized:
- Only checks lines that changed
- Runs after typing stops (0.1s delay)
- Doesn't slow down paste operations
- Minimal impact on editing responsiveness

### Working with Breakpoints

Breakpoints can be toggled on any line using `Ctrl+B`. The status column shows:
- Line with breakpoint only: `●`
- Line with error only: `?`
- Line with both: `?` (error takes priority)

**How to use breakpoints:**
1. Position cursor on any line
2. Press `Ctrl+B` to toggle breakpoint
3. Status bar shows "Breakpoint set on line X" or "Breakpoint removed from line X"
4. Line's status column updates to show `●` (or `?` if line also has error)

**Priority system:** When a line has both an error and a breakpoint, the error (`?`) is shown. After fixing the error, the breakpoint indicator (`●`) becomes visible.

### Debugger Commands

The curses UI includes a full-featured debugger for step-by-step execution and debugging.

#### Setting Breakpoints

1. Position cursor on the line where you want to pause
2. Press `Ctrl+B` to toggle breakpoint
3. Status column shows `●` for lines with breakpoints
4. Run program with `Ctrl+R`

#### Debugger Commands

| Command | Key | Description |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| **Step** | `Ctrl+T` | Execute one line and pause |
| **Continue** | `Ctrl+G` | Continue execution until next breakpoint or end |
| **Stop** | `Ctrl+X` | Stop program execution immediately |

#### Debugging Workflow

**Basic debugging:**
```
1. Set breakpoint on line 20:
   ●   20 FOR I = 1 TO 10

2. Run program (Ctrl+R)
   → Program runs and pauses at line 20
   Output: "● Breakpoint hit at line 20"
   Status: "Paused at line 20 - Ctrl+T=Step, Ctrl+G=Continue, Ctrl+X=Stop"

3. Step through (Ctrl+T)
   → Executes line 20, pauses at line 30
   Output: "→ Paused at line 30"

4. Continue (Ctrl+G)
   → Runs until next breakpoint or program end

5. Stop (Ctrl+X)
   → Stops execution immediately
   Output: "Program stopped by user"
```

**Stepping through code:**
```
Program:
●   10 X = 0
    20 FOR I = 1 TO 3
    30   X = X + I
    40   PRINT X
    50 NEXT I

Workflow:
1. Ctrl+R → Runs and hits breakpoint at line 10
2. Ctrl+T → Executes line 10, pauses at line 20
3. Ctrl+T → Executes line 20, pauses at line 30
4. Ctrl+T → Executes line 30, pauses at line 40
5. Ctrl+T → Executes line 40 (prints "1"), pauses at line 50
6. Ctrl+G → Continues to end of program
```

**Multiple breakpoints:**
```
●   10 PRINT "Start"
    20 FOR I = 1 TO 5
●   30   PRINT I
    40 NEXT I
●   50 PRINT "Done"

Workflow:
1. Ctrl+R → Pauses at line 10
2. Ctrl+G → Runs lines 10-20, pauses at line 30
3. Ctrl+G → Prints "1", continues loop, pauses at line 30 again
4. Ctrl+G → Prints "2", continues loop, pauses at line 30 again
   (Repeats for each loop iteration)
5. Ctrl+G → After loop ends, pauses at line 50
6. Ctrl+G → Prints "Done", program ends
```

#### Debugger Messages

**Breakpoint hit:**
```
● Breakpoint hit at line 20
```

**Stepping:**
```
→ Paused at line 30
```

**Program status:**
- Status bar shows: "Paused at line X - Ctrl+T=Step, Ctrl+G=Continue, Ctrl+X=Stop"
- Clear indication of available commands
- Current line number displayed

**Stopping:**
```
Program stopped by user
```

#### Visual Statement Highlighting

When stepping through code with `Ctrl+T`, the active statement is highlighted with a colored background (cyan). This is especially useful for lines with multiple colon-separated statements.

**Example:**
```
Line with single statement:
    10 PRINT "Hello"
    → Entire statement highlighted when stepping

Line with multiple statements:
    20 X = 5 : Y = 10 : PRINT X + Y
    → When stepping:
      Step 1: "X = 5" highlighted (statement 1/3)
      Step 2: "Y = 10" highlighted (statement 2/3)
      Step 3: "PRINT X + Y" highlighted (statement 3/3)
```

**Features:**
- Each statement in a multi-statement line is highlighted separately
- Colored background (cyan) makes the active statement obvious
- Highlighting clears when you continue (Ctrl+G) or stop (Ctrl+X)
- Status bar shows statement number: "Paused at line 20 statement 2"

**Typical workflow:**
```
Program:
    10 A = 1 : B = 2 : C = A + B : PRINT C

1. Set breakpoint on line 10 (Ctrl+B)
2. Run (Ctrl+R)
   → Pauses at line 10, "A = 1" highlighted in cyan
3. Step (Ctrl+T)
   → "B = 2" highlighted in cyan
   Status: "Paused at line 10 statement 2"
4. Step (Ctrl+T)
   → "C = A + B" highlighted in cyan
   Status: "Paused at line 10 statement 3"
5. Step (Ctrl+T)
   → "PRINT C" highlighted in cyan, prints "3"
   Status: "Paused at line 10 statement 4"
```

#### Tips

- **Set multiple breakpoints** - Pause at different points in your code
- **Step through loops** - Use Ctrl+T to see each iteration
- **Continue past breakpoints** - Use Ctrl+G to skip to next interesting point
- **Stop anytime** - Press Ctrl+X if program is stuck or running too long
- **Combine with output** - Watch output window to see results of each step
- **Multi-statement lines** - Use statement highlighting to see exactly which part is executing
- **Watch variables** - Press Ctrl+W to show/hide the variables window
- **View execution stack** - Press Ctrl+K to show/hide the call stack and loop nesting

### Watch Window (Variables)

The variables watch window shows all current variables and their values during program execution. It updates automatically when stepping through code.

#### Using the Watch Window

**Toggle visibility:**
- Press `Ctrl+W` to show/hide the variables window
- Window appears between the Editor and Output sections
- Only useful when a program is running or paused

**What it shows:**
- All scalar variables with their current values
- Arrays with their dimensions
- Variables sorted alphabetically for easy scanning
- Type suffixes shown (%, $, !, #)

**Example display:**
```
┌─ Variables (Ctrl+W to toggle) ─────────┐
│ COUNTER%     = 5                       │
│ I!           = 3                       │
│ MSG$         = "Hello"                 │
│ MATRIX%      = Array(10x10)            │
│ X!           = 1.5                     │
│ Y!           = 2.75                    │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**When it updates:**
- Automatically after each step (Ctrl+T)
- When paused at a breakpoint
- Shows current state when you toggle it on

**Typical workflow:**
```
1. Set breakpoint on line 10
2. Press Ctrl+R to run
3. Program pauses at line 10
4. Press Ctrl+W to show variables window
5. Press Ctrl+T to step - watch variables update
6. Press Ctrl+T again - see new values
7. Press Ctrl+W to hide when not needed
```

**Variable formats:**
- **Integers** (`%`): `COUNTER% = 42`
- **Single precision** (`!`): `X! = 3.14159`
- **Double precision** (`#`): `PI# = 3.14159265358979`
- **Strings** (`$`): `NAME$ = "Alice"`
- **Arrays**: `DATA% = Array(100)` or `MATRIX% = Array(10x20)`

**Tips:**
- Toggle on/off as needed - doesn't slow execution
- Useful for tracking loop variables during stepping
- Arrays show dimensions, not contents (too large to display)
- Variables appear as soon as they're assigned
- Empty display shows "(no variables yet)"

### Execution Stack Window

The execution stack window shows the current call stack and active loops. It displays GOSUB calls, FOR loops, and WHILE loops in their proper nesting order. Updates automatically when stepping through code.

#### Using the Stack Window

**Toggle visibility:**
- Press `Ctrl+K` to show/hide the execution stack window
- Window appears between editor and output (or after variables window if visible)
- Most useful when debugging nested subroutines and loops

**What it shows:**
- GOSUB return addresses with originating line numbers
- Active FOR loops with current variable values
- Active WHILE loops with line numbers
- Indentation shows nesting depth
- Displays oldest (outermost) to newest (innermost) top-to-bottom

**Example display:**
```
┌─ Execution Stack (Ctrl+K to toggle) ──┐
│ GOSUB from line 20                     │
│   FOR I! = 2 TO 5 (line 110)          │
│     WHILE (line 130)                   │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This shows: main program called subroutine from line 20, which started a FOR loop (currently I=2), inside which is an active WHILE loop.

**When it updates:**
- Automatically after each step (Ctrl+T)
- When paused at a breakpoint
- When GOSUB/RETURN or loop entry/exit occurs
- Shows current state when you toggle it on

**Stack entry formats:**
- **GOSUB**: `GOSUB from line 50` - subroutine was called from line 50
- **FOR loop**: `FOR I! = 3 TO 10 STEP 2 (line 100)` - loop at line 100, I currently 3
- **WHILE loop**: `WHILE (line 200)` - WHILE loop started at line 200

**Typical workflow:**
```
1. Write program with nested GOSUB and loops
2. Set breakpoint inside nested section
3. Press Ctrl+R to run
4. Press Ctrl+K to show stack window
5. Press Ctrl+T to step - watch stack grow/shrink
6. See exactly where you are in the nesting
7. Press Ctrl+K to hide when not needed
```

**Benefits:**
- See the full call chain and loop nesting at a glance
- Understand where you are in deeply nested code
- Verify proper nesting (unified stack detects nesting errors)
- Track loop progress (current value, end value, step)
- Debug complex control flow

**Tips:**
- Indentation shows nesting depth visually
- Stack grows downward (newest at bottom)
- Empty stack shows "(empty stack)" when at top level
- Stack is empty before any GOSUB or loop entered
- Helps visualize recursion depth

### Line Editing Commands

#### Delete Line (Ctrl+D)

Quickly delete the current line where the cursor is positioned.

**Usage:**
1. Position cursor on any line
2. Press `Ctrl+D`
3. Line is immediately removed
4. Status bar shows "Deleted line X"
5. Cursor moves to next line (or previous if at end)

**What gets deleted:**
- The line from the display
- The line from the program
- Any breakpoint on that line
- Any syntax error for that line

**Example:**
```
Before:                After Ctrl+D:
●   10 PRINT "A"      ●   10 PRINT "A"
    20 PRINT "B"  ←       30 PRINT "C"
    30 PRINT "C"
```

#### Renumber Lines (Ctrl+E)

Renumber all program lines with custom start and increment values.

**Usage:**
1. Press `Ctrl+E`
2. Enter start line number (default: 10)
3. Enter increment (default: 10)
4. All lines are renumbered
5. Status bar shows "Renumbered N lines from X by Y"

**What gets updated:**
- All line numbers in sequence
- Breakpoints move to new line numbers
- Syntax errors move to new line numbers
- Status indicators preserved

**Example:**
```
Before:                After RENUM 100, 5:
    15 PRINT "A"           100 PRINT "A"
●   27 PRINT "B"       ●   105 PRINT "B"
?   38 PRINT "C"       ?   110 PRINT "C"
    49 END                 115 END
```

**Dialog prompts:**
- "RENUM - Start line number (default 10):" - Press Enter for default or type number
- "RENUM - Increment (default 10):" - Press Enter for default or type number

**Notes:**
- Empty input uses default values (10, 10)
- Only renumbers lines with valid line numbers
- Preserves all breakpoints and error markers
- Does NOT update GOTO/GOSUB references (use CLI RENUM for that)

### Error Messages

The curses UI provides enhanced error messages with context and helpful formatting.

#### Error Types

**1. Syntax Errors (shown while editing):**
```
┌─ Syntax Errors ──────────────────────────────────┐
│
│ Line 10:
│   foo
│   ^^^^
│ Error: Invalid statement: 'foo' is not a BASIC keyword
│
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**2. Parse Errors (when running program):**
```
┌─ Parse Error ────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Line 20:
│   FOR I = 1 TO
│   ^^^^
│ Error: Expected expression after TO
│
│ Fix the syntax error and try running again.
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**3. Runtime Errors (during execution):**
```
┌─ Runtime Error ──────────────────────────────────┐
│ Line 30:
│   PRINT 1/0
│   ^^^^
│ Error: Division by zero
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**4. Execution Errors (unexpected errors):**
```
┌─ Execution Error ────────────────────────────────┐
│ TypeError: unsupported operand type(s)
│
│ An error occurred during program execution.
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Error Message Features

- **Boxed formatting** - Clear visual separation from output
- **Code context** - Shows the actual line of code that failed
- **Line numbers** - Easy to locate the problem
- **Error indicators** - `^^^^` points to the problematic code
- **Helpful hints** - Suggestions for fixing common errors
- **Status bar updates** - Quick error type indication

## Automatic Line Sorting

Lines are automatically sorted by line number when:

1. **Moving to a different line** (up/down arrows) while in line number area
2. **Navigating with Page Up/Down, Home, End**
3. **Executing any control command** (Ctrl+R, Ctrl+S, etc.)
4. **Pressing Enter** to create a new line

**Example workflow:**
```
1. Start with:    10 PRINT "A"
                  20 PRINT "B"
                  30 PRINT "C"

2. Go to line 10, edit number to '25':
                  25 PRINT "A"    ← edited, not sorted yet
                  20 PRINT "B"
                  30 PRINT "C"

3. Press Down arrow → Automatic sort:
                  20 PRINT "B"
                  25 PRINT "A"    ← sorted into position
                  30 PRINT "C"
```

## Implementation Details

### Architecture

The urwid UI follows the standard `UIBackend` interface defined in `src/ui/base.py`:

```python
class CursesBackend(UIBackend):
    """Urwid-based curses UI backend."""

    def __init__(self, io_handler, program_manager):
        # Initialize widgets
        self.editor = EditorWidget()
        self.output = urwid.Text("")
        self.status_bar = urwid.Text("...")

    def start(self):
        # Create UI layout
        self._create_ui()
        # Run main loop
        self.loop.run()
```

### Program Execution

When you press `Ctrl+R`, the UI:

1. **Parses editor content** - Extracts line-numbered statements
2. **Loads into program manager** - Converts text to program lines
3. **Creates capturing IO handler** - Intercepts PRINT output
4. **Runs interpreter** - Executes the program
5. **Displays results** - Shows output in the output window

### Output Capture

Program output is captured using a custom IO handler:

```python
class CapturingIOHandler:
    def __init__(self, output_list):
        self.output_list = output_list

    def output(self, text, end='\n'):
        """Capture PRINT statements to list."""
        self.output_list.append(str(text))
```

This allows PRINT statements to display in the output window instead of the terminal.

### Widget Structure

The UI uses urwid's pile layout:

```python
pile = urwid.Pile([
    ('weight', 7, editor_frame),    # 70% - Editor
    ('weight', 3, output_frame),    # 30% - Output
    ('pack', self.status_bar)       # Fixed - Status
])
```
