However, there's a subtle inconsistency: CLEAR accesses file_obj directly from runtime.files, while RESET accesses file_obj['handle']. This suggests CLEAR might be using an older data structure format where files[file_num] is the file object directly, not a dict with 'handle' key. This is an inconsistency in how the two methods access the file structure.",
