## ⚠ Partially Implemented

### WHILE/WEND Loops
- **Status:** Parsed but not fully implemented
- **What works:** Parser recognizes syntax
- **What's missing:** Runtime execution raises NotImplementedError
- **Workaround:** Use FOR/NEXT or GOTO loops

### Built-in Functions (Hardware/System)
- **PEEK, POKE, INP, OUT, CALL, USR**
  - **Status:** Parsed, but return placeholder values or do nothing
  - **Reason:** Requires hardware emulation or system-level access
  - **Not planned:** These are CP/M-specific and not relevant for modern use

- **INKEY$**
  - **Status:** Partially implemented
  - **What works:** Returns empty string when no key pressed
  - **What's missing:** Non-blocking keyboard input
  - **Note:** Currently blocks waiting for Enter key

## ✗ Not Yet Implemented

### 1. Error Handling
**Priority:** High

- ✗ **ON ERROR GOTO** - Set error trap
- ✗ **RESUME** - Resume after error
- ✗ **RESUME NEXT** - Resume at next statement
- ✗ **RESUME line** - Resume at specific line

**Status:** Parsed but not executed
**Impact:** Programs cannot trap and handle runtime errors
**Current behavior:** Errors terminate program with Python exception

### 2. Sequential File I/O
**Priority:** High

- ✗ **OPEN "filename" FOR INPUT/OUTPUT/APPEND AS #n** - Open file
- ✗ **CLOSE #n** - Close file
- ✗ **PRINT #n, ...** - Write to file
- ✗ **INPUT #n, var1, var2, ...** - Read from file
- ✗ **LINE INPUT #n, var$** - Read line from file
- ✗ **WRITE #n, ...** - Write comma-delimited data
- ✗ **EOF(n)** - Test for end of file

**Status:** Parsed but not executed
**Impact:** Cannot read from or write to text files
**Workaround:** Use SAVE/LOAD for program files only

### 3. Random Access File I/O
**Priority:** Medium

- ✗ **OPEN "filename" AS #n LEN=reclen** - Open random file
- ✗ **FIELD #n, width AS var$, ...** - Define record layout
- ✗ **GET #n [,record]** - Read record
- ✗ **PUT #n [,record]** - Write record
- ✗ **LSET var$ = value$** - Left-justify in field
- ✗ **RSET var$ = value$** - Right-justify in field
- ✗ **LOC(n)** - Get current record position
- ✗ **LOF(n)** - Get file length

**Status:** Parsed but not executed
**Impact:** Cannot access random-access database files

### 4. File System Operations
**Priority:** Medium

- ✗ **KILL "filename"** - Delete file
- ✗ **NAME "old" AS "new"** - Rename file
- ✗ **RESET** - Close all open files

**Status:** Parsed but not executed
**Impact:** Cannot manage files from within BASIC programs

### 5. Computed Jumps
**Priority:** Medium

- ✗ **ON expression GOTO line1, line2, ...** - Computed GOTO
- ✗ **ON expression GOSUB line1, line2, ...** - Computed GOSUB

**Status:** Parsed but not executed
**Impact:** Cannot do multi-way branching
**Workaround:** Use IF/THEN/ELSE chains

### 6. String Manipulation
**Priority:** Low

- ✗ **MID$(var$, start, len) = value$** - Replace substring in-place

**Status:** Parsed but not executed
**Impact:** Cannot modify strings in-place
**Workaround:** Use LEFT$, MID$, RIGHT$ to rebuild strings

### 7. Variable Operations
**Priority:** Low

- ✗ **SWAP var1, var2** - Exchange values of two variables

**Status:** Parsed but not executed
**Impact:** Minor convenience feature
**Workaround:** Use temp variable

### 8. Output Control
**Priority:** Low

- ✗ **WIDTH [#filenum,] width** - Set output width
- ✗ **LPRINT** - Print to printer

**Status:** Parsed but not executed
**Impact:** Cannot control display width or print to printer

### 9. Graphics and Sound
**Priority:** Very Low (Not Planned)

Graphics commands (SCREEN, LINE, CIRCLE, PSET, etc.) and sound commands (SOUND, BEEP, PLAY) are not part of MBASIC 5.21 core specification and are not planned for implementation.

## Testing Status

### Parser Tests
- **Coverage:** 121/121 files (100%)
- **Status:** All valid MBASIC 5.21 programs parse successfully
- **Test corpus:** 120+ real MBASIC programs from vintage sources

### Interpreter Tests
- **Core features:** Fully tested
- **Self-checking tests:** 20/20 pass
- **Manual testing:** Extensive testing with vintage programs
- **File I/O:** Not tested (not implemented)
- **Error handling:** Not tested (not implemented)

## Compatibility Notes

### What Works
Programs that use:
- Mathematical calculations
- String processing
- Arrays and data structures
- Control flow (IF, FOR, GOSUB)
- User input/output
- DATA statements
- User-defined functions

### What Doesn't Work
Programs that require:
- File I/O (reading/writing data files)
- Error trapping (ON ERROR GOTO)
- WHILE/WEND loops (use FOR/NEXT instead)
- Computed jumps (ON GOTO/GOSUB)
- Hardware access (PEEK, POKE, ports)

## Roadmap

### Phase 1 (Current) - Core Language ✓
- ✓ Complete parser
- ✓ Basic interpreter
- ✓ Interactive mode
- ✓ Essential built-in functions

### Phase 2 (In Progress) - File I/O

- ⚠ EOF() function
- ⚠ LINE INPUT # statement

### Phase 3 (Planned) - Advanced Features
- ⚠ Error handling (ON ERROR GOTO, RESUME)
- ⚠ WHILE/WEND loops
- ⚠ Computed jumps (ON GOTO/GOSUB)
- ⚠ Random file I/O (FIELD, GET, PUT, LSET, RSET)

### Phase 4 (Future) - Enhancements
- Documentation improvements
- Performance optimization
- Extended error messages
- Debugging features

### Not Planned
- Graphics commands (hardware-specific)
- Sound commands (hardware-specific)
- Printer support (LPRINT)
- Direct hardware access (PEEK, POKE, INP, OUT)

## Known Limitations

1. **No file I/O** - Cannot read or write data files
2. **No error handling** - Programs cannot trap errors
3. **No WHILE/WEND** - Use FOR/NEXT or GOTO instead
4. **No computed jumps** - Use IF/THEN chains instead
5. **INKEY$ blocks** - Waits for Enter instead of single keypress
6. **No random files** - Cannot access binary data files
7. **Integer division precision** - May differ slightly from original MBASIC due to Python float handling

## Testing Your Program

To check if your MBASIC program will work:

1. **Parser test:**
   ```bash
   python3 mbasic.py yourprogram.bas
   ```
   If it parses without errors, the syntax is valid.

2. **Check for unimplemented features:**
   - Look for "NotImplementedError" when running
   - Review the "Not Yet Implemented" section above
   - Check if your program uses file I/O, error handling, or WHILE/WEND

3. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   # Run self-checking tests
   python3 mbasic.py basic/tests_with_results/test_operator_precedence.bas
   ```
