## ⚠ Partially Implemented

### Built-in Functions (Hardware/System)
- **PEEK, POKE, INP, OUT, CALL, USR**
  - **Status:** Parsed, but return placeholder values or do nothing
  - **Reason:** Requires hardware emulation or system-level access
  - **Not planned:** These are CP/M-specific and not relevant for modern use

## ✗ Not Yet Implemented

### 1. Formatted Output (High Priority)
**Priority:** High - Commonly used features

- ✗ **PRINT USING** - Format output with format strings (e.g., "###.##" for numbers)
- ✗ **PRINT# USING** - Format file output with format strings
- ✗ **TAB(n)** - Tab to column n in PRINT statements
- ✗ **SPC(n)** - Print n spaces in PRINT statements

**Status:** Not implemented
**Impact:** Cannot format numbers/strings for display or tabulate output
**Workaround:** Manual string formatting with SPACE$ and STR$

### 2. Binary File I/O Functions (Medium Priority)
**Priority:** Medium - Needed for binary random file operations

- ✗ **CVI/CVS/CVD** - Convert 2/4/8 byte string to integer/single/double
- ✗ **MKI$/MKS$/MKD$** - Convert integer/single/double to 2/4/8 byte string

**Status:** Not implemented
**Impact:** Cannot read/write binary numeric data in random files
**Workaround:** Use text representation with STR$ and VAL

### 3. Debugging and System Functions (Low Priority)
**Priority:** Low - Useful but not critical

- ✗ **TRON/TROFF** - Trace program execution (shows line numbers as they execute)
- ✗ **FRE(n)** - Return free memory available
- ✗ **VARPTR(var)** - Return memory address of variable

**Status:** Not implemented
**Impact:** Less debugging support and memory introspection
**Workaround:** Use other debugging techniques

### 4. Variable and Terminal Operations (Low Priority)
**Priority:** Low - Minor convenience features

- ✗ **SWAP var1, var2** - Exchange values of two variables
- ✗ **NULL n** - Set number of nulls after carriage return
- ✗ **WIDTH [#filenum,] width** - Set output width

**Status:** Parsed but not executed (SWAP, WIDTH); Not implemented (NULL)
**Impact:** Minor convenience features
**Workaround:** Use temp variable for SWAP; not needed for NULL/WIDTH on modern terminals

### 5. Printer Support (Not Planned)
**Priority:** Very Low - Obsolete hardware

- ✗ **LPRINT/LPRINT USING** - Print to printer
- ✗ **LLIST** - List program to printer
- ✗ **LPOS(n)** - Get printer head position

**Status:** Not implemented
**Impact:** Cannot print to line printer
**Note:** Not planned - obsolete hardware interface

## Testing Status

### Parser Tests
- **Coverage:** 121/121 files (100%)
- **Status:** All valid MBASIC 5.21 programs parse successfully
- **Test corpus:** 120+ real MBASIC programs from vintage sources

### Interpreter Tests
- **Core features:** Fully tested
- **Self-checking tests:** 20/20 pass
- **Manual testing:** Extensive testing with vintage programs
- **Error handling:** Fully tested (ON ERROR GOTO/GOSUB, RESUME variants)
- **WHILE/WEND:** Tested with nested loops
- **INKEY$:** Tested with cross-platform support
- **ON GOTO/GOSUB:** Tested with multiple values, out-of-range, expressions
- **File system ops:** Tested (KILL, NAME AS, RESET)
- **Sequential file I/O:** Fully tested (OPEN, CLOSE, PRINT#, INPUT#, LINE INPUT#, WRITE#, EOF with ^Z support)
- **Random file I/O:** Fully tested (FIELD, GET, PUT, LSET, RSET, LOC, LOF)
- **MID$ assignment:** Fully tested (replace substring in-place, simple vars and arrays)

## Compatibility Notes

## Known Limitations

1. **Integer division precision** - May differ slightly from original MBASIC due to Python float handling

## Testing Your Program

To check if your MBASIC program will work:

1. **Parser test:**
   ```bash
   python3 mbasic.py yourprogram.bas
   ```
   If it parses without errors, the syntax is valid.

2. **Check for unimplemented features:**
   - Look for "NotImplementedError" when running
   - Review the "Not Yet Implemented" section above
   - Check if your program uses file I/O or computed jumps

3. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   # Run self-checking tests
   python3 mbasic.py basic/tests_with_results/test_operator_precedence.bas
   ```
