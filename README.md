# MBASIC-2025: Modern MBASIC 5.21 Interpreter

A modern implementation of Microsoft BASIC-80 5.21 (CP/M era) with optional development extensions, written in Python.

> **About MBASIC:** MBASIC was a BASIC interpreter originally developed by Microsoft in the late 1970s. This is an independent, open-source reimplementation created for educational purposes and historical software preservation. See [MBASIC History](docs/MBASIC_HISTORY.md) for more information.

**Status:** Full MBASIC 5.21 implementation complete with 100% compatibility, plus modern debugging and UI features.
- ✅ **100% Compatible**: All original MBASIC 5.21 programs run unchanged
- ✅ **Modern Extensions**: Optional debugging commands (BREAK, STEP, WATCH, STACK)
- ✅ **Multiple UIs**: CLI (classic), Curses, Tk (GUI), Web (browser)

See [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) for implementation details, [Extensions](docs/help/mbasic/extensions.md) for modern features, and [PROJECT_STATUS.md](docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md) for current project health and metrics.

## Installation

### From PyPI (Prepared, Not Yet Published)

**Status**: Package is prepared and tested, awaiting publication to PyPI.

Once published, you'll be able to install with:

```bash
# Minimal install - CLI backend only (zero dependencies)
pip install mbasic

# With full-screen terminal UI (curses backend)
pip install mbasic[curses]

# With graphical UI (tkinter - included with Python)
pip install mbasic[tk]

# With all UI backends
pip install mbasic[all]

# For development
pip install mbasic[dev]
```

**Building from source**: See `docs/dev/DISTRIBUTION_TESTING.md` for instructions on building and testing the package.

**Note:** Tkinter is included with most Python installations. If missing:
- **Debian/Ubuntu:** `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`
- **RHEL/Fedora:** `sudo dnf install python3-tkinter`
- **macOS/Windows:** Reinstall Python from [python.org](https://python.org)

### From Source

For detailed installation instructions including virtual environment setup, see **[INSTALL.md](docs/user/INSTALL.md)**.

**Quick install:**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/avwohl/mbasic.git
cd mbasic

# Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies (optional - only needed for curses UI)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the interpreter
python3 mbasic
```

### Check Available Backends

```bash
python3 mbasic --list-backends
```

This shows which UI backends are available on your system.

## Quick Start

### Run a BASIC program

```bash
python3 mbasic myprogram.bas
```

### Start interactive mode (Curses Screen Editor)

```bash
python3 mbasic
```

The **curses screen editor** (default) provides a full-screen terminal interface:
- Visual line editor with auto-numbering
- Status indicators for breakpoints and errors
- **Automatic syntax checking** (marks parse errors with '?')
- Calculator-style line number editing
- Automatic line sorting
- Split-screen output window
- Optimized paste performance (instant display)
- Smart line number parsing (preserves pasted line numbers)
- Edge-to-edge display (clean copy/paste without borders)

**Features:**
- `Ctrl+R` - Run program
- `Ctrl+S` - Save program
- `Ctrl+O` - Open program
- `Ctrl+B` - Toggle breakpoint on current line
- `Ctrl+D` - Delete current line
- `Ctrl+E` - Renumber all lines (RENUM)
- `Ctrl+H` - Help
- `Tab` - Switch between editor and output
- Arrow keys, Page Up/Down for navigation
- Auto-numbering with smart collision avoidance
- Fast paste operations with automatic formatting

**Debugger:**
- `Ctrl+G` - Continue execution (from breakpoint)
- `Ctrl+T` - Step (execute one line)
- `Ctrl+X` - Stop execution

See **[Curses Editor Documentation](docs/user/URWID_UI.md)** for complete guide.

### CLI Mode (Line-by-line REPL)

```bash
python3 mbasic --ui cli
```

Then enter your program:

```basic
MBASIC 5.21 Interpreter
Ready

10 PRINT "Hello, World!"
20 FOR I = 1 TO 10
30 PRINT I
40 NEXT I
50 END
RUN
LIST
SAVE "hello.bas"
```

## Testing

MBASIC has a comprehensive test suite with automated regression tests and BASIC program tests.

### Quick Start

Run all regression tests:
```bash
python3 tests/run_regression.py
```

Run tests in a specific category:
```bash
python3 tests/run_regression.py --category lexer
python3 tests/run_regression.py --category interpreter
```

└── run_regression.py   # Test runner script
```

### Test Categories

- **regression/** - Automated tests (deterministic, repeatable)
- **manual/** - Tests requiring human verification
- **debug/** - Temporary debugging tests (not tracked in git)

### BASIC Test Programs

Test BASIC programs live in `basic/bas_tests/`:

```bash
# Run any BASIC test program
python3 mbasic basic/bas_tests/test_operator_precedence.bas
```

Self-checking tests verify correctness and report results:
```bash
python3 mbasic basic/tests_with_results/test_operator_precedence.bas
# Result: All 20 tests PASS
```

### Writing Tests

Test files must:
- Start with `test_` prefix
- Use `src.` prefix for imports (`from src.lexer import Lexer`)
- Exit with code 0 on success, 1 on failure
- Include clear assertion messages

Example test structure:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys
import os

# Add project root to path (3 levels up from tests/regression/category/)
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '../../..'))

from src.lexer import Lexer

def test_feature():
    lexer = Lexer("10 PRINT \"Hello\"")
    tokens = lexer.tokenize()
    assert len(tokens) > 0, "Should tokenize code"
    print("✓ Feature works")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_feature()
        print("\n✅ All tests passed")
        sys.exit(0)
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(f"\n❌ Test failed: {e}")
        sys.exit(1)
```

**See [tests/README.md](tests/README.md) for complete testing guide.**

### Implementation Complete

All core MBASIC 5.21 features are implemented and tested.

**See [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) for complete implementation status.**

**What doesn't work:**
- Hardware-specific features (PEEK/POKE for hardware access, INP/OUT ports)
- Line printer output (LPRINT, LLIST)
- Graphics/sound (not part of MBASIC 5.21 core spec)

These limitations are inherent to running vintage BASIC in a modern environment and do not affect most programs. See STATUS.md for details on compatibility features.

## Example Programs

### Factorial Calculator

```basic
10 REM Factorial calculator
20 INPUT "Enter a number"; N
30 F = 1
40 FOR I = 1 TO N
50 F = F * I
60 NEXT I
70 PRINT "Factorial of"; N; "is"; F
80 END
```

### Prime Number Checker

```basic
10 INPUT "Enter a number"; N
20 IF N < 2 THEN PRINT "Not prime" : END
30 FOR I = 2 TO SQR(N)
40 IF N MOD I = 0 THEN PRINT "Not prime" : END
50 NEXT I
60 PRINT "Prime!"
70 END
```

### Fibonacci Sequence

```basic
10 INPUT "How many numbers"; N
20 A = 0
30 B = 1
40 FOR I = 1 TO N
50 PRINT A;
60 C = A + B
70 A = B
80 B = C
90 NEXT I
100 END
```
