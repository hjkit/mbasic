# Classic BASIC Games

This directory contains 113 classic BASIC games from various archives.

## Status

These programs were written for various BASIC dialects and may require fixes to work with MBASIC 5.21.

### Working Games

- **superstartrek.bas** - Fixed and tested (briefly). The classic Super Star Trek game should be playable.

- Missing spaces after keywords (THEN, GOTO, etc.)
- Syntax differences from MBASIC 5.21
- Unsupported features or commands

1. Use the `utils/fix_keyword_spacing.py` utility to fix missing spaces after keywords:
   ```bash

   ```

2. Report problems or contribute fixes
