Test 1: RANDOMIZE with specific seed
First random number:  0.6394267984578837
Second random number:  0.025010755222666936
Third random number:  0.27502931836911926

Test 2: RANDOMIZE with same seed (should give same sequence)
First random number:  0.6394267984578837  (should match above)
Second random number:  0.025010755222666936  (should match above)
Third random number:  0.27502931836911926  (should match above)

Test 3: RANDOMIZE with different seed
First random number:  0.052363598850944326  (should be different)
Second random number:  0.08718667752263232  (should be different)
Third random number:  0.4072417636703983  (should be different)

Test 4: RANDOMIZE with expression as seed
First random number:  0.1456692551041303
Second random number:  0.45492700451402135

Test 5: RANDOMIZE without seed (uses timer)
Random number with timer seed:  <varies - depends on system time>
Random number with timer seed:  <varies - depends on system time>
