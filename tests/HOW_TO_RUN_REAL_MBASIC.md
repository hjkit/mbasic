# How to Run Real MBASIC 5.21 for Testing

## Setup
- Real MBASIC 5.21 runs via tnylpo CP/M emulator
- Location: `com/mbasic.com`
- Wrapper script: `utils/mbasic521` (but see below - doesn't work as expected)

## Requirements for Test Files

### 1. File Location
Must run from the `tests/` directory:
```bash
cd /home/wohl/cl/mbasic/tests
```

### 2. Program Exit
**CRITICAL**: Programs MUST end with `SYSTEM` not `END`
- `END` leaves you at the "Ok" prompt (hangs waiting for input)
- `SYSTEM` exits MBASIC back to CP/M and tnylpo exits properly

Example:
```basic
10 PRINT "Hello"
20 SYSTEM
```

### 3. Line Length Limits
MBASIC 5.21 has a line buffer limit. Keep lines short:
- Comments: Keep under ~50 characters
- Code lines: Keep reasonable length
- Error: "Line buffer overflow in XX" means line XX is too long

## Running Tests - THE WORKING METHOD

**IMPORTANT**: The `utils/mbasic521` wrapper script does NOT work for passing programs via command line.
MBASIC cannot read the file from command-line arguments when invoked via tnylpo.

### The Correct Way: Pipe Program as Typed Input

You must pipe the program content to MBASIC as if it's being typed:

```bash
cd /home/wohl/cl/mbasic/tests
(cat test.bas && echo "RUN") | timeout 10 tnylpo ../com/mbasic
```

This:
1. Cats the .bas file (types the program lines)
2. Echoes "RUN" command
3. Pipes everything to tnylpo running MBASIC
4. Uses timeout to prevent hanging

### Example: Running hello.bas

```bash
cd /home/wohl/cl/mbasic/tests
(cat hello.bas && echo "RUN") | timeout 5 tnylpo ../com/mbasic
```

Output:
```
BASIC-80 Rev. 5.21

Created: 28-Jul-81

Ok
10 PRINT "Hello from MBASIC!"
20 SYSTEM
RUN
Hello from MBASIC!
```

### Capturing Output to File

```bash
(cat test.bas && echo "RUN") | timeout 10 tnylpo ../com/mbasic 2>&1 | tee output.txt
```

## Common Issues

1. **Using `utils/mbasic521` directly**:
   - This does NOT work - MBASIC can't read files from command line via tnylpo
   - Must pipe program as typed input (see above)

2. **Hangs after running**:
   - Program needs `SYSTEM` at end, not `END`
   - Use `timeout` command to prevent infinite hangs

3. **"Line buffer overflow"**:
   - Shorten the line mentioned in error
   - Break long lines into multiple statements
   - Keep comments under ~50 characters

4. **No output or hangs at "Ok" prompt**:
   - Check program ends with `SYSTEM`, not `END`
   - Make sure you're piping `echo "RUN"` after the program

## Example Working Test

File: `tests/hello.bas`
```basic
10 PRINT "Hello from MBASIC 5.21"
20 PRINT "Math test: 2+2 ="; 2+2
30 SYSTEM
```

Run:
```bash
cd /home/wohl/cl/mbasic/tests
(cat hello.bas && echo "RUN") | timeout 5 tnylpo ../com/mbasic
```

## Comparing Output

To compare our MBASIC vs real MBASIC:
```bash
cd /home/wohl/cl/mbasic/tests

# Run on our implementation
python3 ../mbasic.py mytest.bas > /tmp/our_output.txt 2>&1

# Run on real MBASIC
(cat mytest.bas && echo "RUN") | timeout 10 tnylpo ../com/mbasic > /tmp/real_output.txt 2>&1

# Compare
diff /tmp/our_output.txt /tmp/real_output.txt
```

## Why This Method Works

MBASIC 5.21 was designed for CP/M's interactive environment. When you pass a filename on the command line to tnylpo:
- tnylpo passes it to MBASIC as a CP/M command-line argument
- MBASIC doesn't parse command-line arguments for auto-loading files
- It just starts at the "Ok" prompt waiting for typed commands

By piping the file contents:
- MBASIC receives the program lines as if typed at the keyboard
- Each line is entered into the program buffer
- The "RUN" command executes the program
- `SYSTEM` exits back to CP/M (and tnylpo exits)
